I expect to complete my PhD in September 2017. And you can contact me at **huboshufe at gmail dot com**.\r\n\r\nMy research interests are in applied and theoretical labor economics and industrial organization, particularly in search and matching. Specifically, my research focuses why intermediaries choose to combine different inter-mediation modes; the effect of state owned firms on China's labor market misallocation; the application of labor market frictions on executives/CEO compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Research\r\n#### **Market-making middlemen**, coauthored with Pieter Gautier and Makoto Watanabe\r\nThis paper develops a model in which market structure is determined endogenously by the choice of intermediation mode. We consider two representative business modes of intermediation that are widely used in real-life markets:one is a market-making mode by which an intermediary offers a platform for buyers and sellers to trade with each other; the other is a middleman mode by which an intermediary holds inventories which he stocks from sellers for the purpose of reselling to buyers. In our model, buyers and sellers can simultaneously search in an outside market and use the service offered by the monopolist. We derive the condition under which the mixture of the two intermediation modes is selected over an exclusive use of either of the modes.\r\n\r\n#### **Chinese labor market**\r\nUse a text section to describe your values, show more info, summarize a topic, or tell a story.

In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
