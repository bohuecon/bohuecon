<p>I am a PhD candidate in Economics at VU University Amsterdam and Tinbergen Institute, under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/makotowtnb/">Makoto Watanabe</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/pietgautier/">Pieter Gautier</a>. I expect to complete my PhD in September 2017.</p>
        
<p>My primary areas of research are labor economics and industrial organization, particularly in labor search and consumer search. </p>

<p><b>Market-making middlemen</b>, with Pieter Gautier and Makoto Watanabe, August 2016. <a target="_blank" href="bohuecon.github.io/mm.pdf">[Paper]</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://bohuecon.github.io/reveal.js">[Slides]</a> </p>

<p>Why intermediaries are of different structures? For example, eBay is a pure platform while Amazon combines a platform and its inventory. How is this related to the market competition?  Could this be a pattern that is consistent across intermediaries of different markets --- goods markets, financial markets, real estate markes? This paper develops a model in which market structure is determined endogenously by the choice of intermediation mode. We consider two representative business modes of intermediation that are widely used in real-life markets: one is a middleman mode where an intermediary holds inventories which he stocks from sellers for the purpose of reselling to buyers; the other is a market-making mode where an intermediary offers a platform for buyers and sellers to trade with each other. In our model, buyers and sellers can simultaneously search in an outside market and use the intermediation service. We show that a marketmaking middleman, who adopts the mixture of these two intermediation modes, can emerge in a directed search equilibrium.</p>

<p><b>Competing Market-making Middlemen</b><br>This project extends <em>market-making middlemen</em> by having two intermediaries competing on prices/fees. Under various announcement sequences, we show the same intuition carries through and a market-making middleman emerges endogenously.</p>

<!-- <p><b>State Owned Firms and Labor Market Equilibrium</b><br>People are longing for job stability, and indeed there is such a sector that provides this --- the state owned enterprises (SOEs). But this sector crowds out efficient firms and brings instability to the general workers, as we identify in the structure model.</p> -->

<p><b>Executive Compensation and Search Frictions</b><br>Why executives/CEOs are compensated so differently among firms of different sizes? Other than traditional theories such as asymmetric information or rent extraction, is there an explanation that search frictions can contribute?</p>
