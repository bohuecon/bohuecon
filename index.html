          <p>I am a PhD candidate in Economics at <a target="_blank" href="http://vu-economics.nl/">Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tinbergen.nl/">Tinbergen Institute</a>, under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/makotowtnb/">Makoto Watanabe</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/site/pietgautier/">Pieter Gautier</a>. My research interests include <span class="strong">executive compensation</span>, <span class="strong">dynamic contracting</span>, <span class="strong">labor search</span>, and <span class="strong">consumer search</span>. </p>
          <p>In my job market paper, titled, "Why do big firms pay more for performance?" I explain the firm-size premium in incentive pays (e.g. bonus, stocks and options) by introducing implicit incentives from executives' on-the-job search behavior and firms' firing decisions. The model is estimated to understand the underlying incentive problems among big and small firms.</p>
          <p>I am on the 2018 job market, and will be available for interviews at the AEA/ASSA annual meeting in Philadelphia in January, 2018. Here is my <b><a target="_blank" href="bohuecon.github.io/Bo Hu.pdf"> CV. </a></b></p>

          <h4>Why Do Big Firms Pay More For Performance? [Job Market Paper]</h4>

          <p>Bo Hu. Draft coming soon.
          <br>In the executives labor market, the incentive pay (e.g. bonus, stocks and options values) increases significantly with firm size. This is the main reason driving the firm-size compensation gap. This paper proposed an explanation based on career concerns, i.e. the possibility to be fired due to bad performance and the possibility to be hired by other firms due to good performance. These career concerns vary with firm size and the executive's position on the job ladder. To quantify this explanation, I develop a market equilibrium model that features a dynamic moral hazard problem inside the firm and a frictional labor market outside the firm. Neither the firm nor the executive can fully commit to the relationship, making firing and job-to-job transition possible. I estimate the model on ExecuComp and BoardEX data and use it to decompose the sources of incentives. It is shown that executives in smaller firms are more likely to be fired after a low realization of output, and receive more implicit incentives via on-the-job search. Hence, big firms have to pay more for performance even when the underlying moral hazard problems are the same as the small firms.</p>

          <h4>Market-making Middlemen <a target="_blank" href="bohuecon.github.io/mm2017.pdf">[Paper]</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://bohuecon.github.io/reveal.js">[Slides]</a> </h4>  
          <p>Pieter Gautier, Bo Hu and Makoto Watanabe. Submitted, August 2017.
          <br>
          This paper develops a model in which market structure is determined endogenously by the choice of intermediation mode. There are two representative modes of intermediation that are widely used in real-life markets: one is a middleman mode where an intermediary holds inventories which he stocks from sellers for the purpose of reselling to buyers; the other is a market-making mode where an intermediary offers a platform for buyers and sellers to trade with each other. We show that a <b>marketmaking middleman</b>, who adopts the mixture of these two intermediation modes, can emerge in a directed search equilibrium. Our main insight survives with competing intermediaries. </p>
