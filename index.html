<p>I am a PhD candidate in Economics at VU University Amsterdam and Tinbergen Institute, under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/makotowtnb/">Makoto Watanabe</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pietgautier/">Pieter Gautier</a>. I expect to complete my PhD in September 2017. </p>

<p>My research interests are in applied and theoretical labor economics and industrial organization, particularly in search and matching. Specifically, my research focuses why intermediaries choose to combine different inter-mediation modes; the effect of state owned firms on China's labor market misallocation; the application of labor market frictions on executives/CEO compensation.</p>

<p><em>Market-making middlemen</em>
with Pieter Gautier and Makoto Watanabe</p>

<p>This paper develops a model in which market structure is determined endogenously by the choice of intermediation mode. We consider two representative business modes of intermediation that are widely used in real-life markets: one is a market-making mode by which an intermediary offers a platform for buyers and sellers to trade with each other; the other is a middleman mode by which an intermediary holds inventories which he stocks from sellers for the purpose of reselling to buyers. In our model, buyers and sellers can simultaneously search in an outside market and use the service offered by the monopolist. We derive the condition under which the mixture of the two intermediation modes is selected over an exclusive use of either of the modes. </p>
